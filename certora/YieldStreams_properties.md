# Properties of YieldStreams

## Overview of the YieldStreams

The smart contract YieldStreams introduces a unique method for yield streaming, utilizing ERC721 tokens to represent individual streams and integrating ERC4626 vaults for yield generation. Each yield stream is uniquely identified by an ERC721 token, allowing for transparent tracking and management. Users can easily create, replenish, transfer, and close yield streams, while also directing generated yield to designated beneficiaries. Leveraging the ERC4626 standard for tokenized vault interactions, the system ensures that these tokens appreciate over time, generating yield for their holders. This cohesive approach combines the benefits of ERC721 streams and ERC4626 vaults, providing a robust framework for managing and profiting from yield streams.

It has mainly the following state variables:
* `vault` (type `IERC4626`), The ERC4626 vault contract used for yield generation.
* `asset` (type `IERC20`), The underlying ERC20 asset of the ERC4626 vault.
* `receiverTotalShares` (type `mapping(address => uint256)`), A mapping that tracks the total number of shares allocated to each receiver across all their yield streams.
* `receiverTotalPrincipal` (type `mapping(address => uint256)`), A mapping that tracks the total principal amount (in asset units) allocated to each receiver across all their yield streams.
* `receiverPrincipal` (type `mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))`), A nested mapping that tracks the principal amount (in asset units) allocated to each individual yield stream for each receiver.
* `streamIdToReceiver` (type `mapping(uint256 => address)`), A mapping that associates each yield stream ID (ERC721 token ID) with the receiver's address.
* `nextStreamId` (type `uint256`), A counter that keeps track of the next available ID for a new yield stream (ERC721 token).
* `name_` (type `string`), The name of the ERC721 token representing the yield streams.
* `symbol_` (type `string`), The symbol of the ERC721 token representing the yield streams.

It has the following external/functions that change state variables:
* `open(address _receiver, uint256 _shares, uint256 _maxLossOnOpenTolerance) public returns (uint256 streamId)`, Opens a new yield stream between the caller (streamer) and a receiver, allocating ERC4626 shares as principal.
